<p>A collective of female laptopists who want to make music with other female laptopists.</p>

<p>OFFAL is an international collective of women laptop performers who devise performances involving multi-location collaborative improvisation. The group was formed in 2015 in response to research around gender in digital technology and laptop ensemble practice . As a non-hierarchical collective it aims to connect an international group of women engaged in electronic music by developing technological systems and organisational structures that facilitate collaboration. The group provides a platform for the creation and performance of new laptop music by women. </p>

<p>OFFAL use an inclusive definition of “women” and “female” and we welcome any member who identifies with a gender other than male.</p>
